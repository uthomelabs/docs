# Utah Home Labs: Lab Guides

This repository and it's [associated wiki](https://github.com/uthomelabs/guides/wiki) can hopefully serve as a reference and/or a starting point for you to get hands-on experience running a number of services in a home lab environment. The main goal here is to help people learn and improve their skills in many areas relating to networking, security, home automation, etc.

## What is Utah Home Labs?

We are a group of (mostly) Utah-native enthusiasts who are passionate about cool things relating to many areas of technology (and even a number of other fun non-tech things). We love making things, learning about and building cool setups with hardware and software, hanging with our infosec friends, helping and sharing knowledge with others, and spending way too much money on secondhand enterprise hardware. We can often be found putting server racks in odd places (like a porch or the middle of a living room), complaining about the state of fiber ISPs, and discussing our love of Costco.

All-in-all we're a fun group of people to hang out with... check us out on Discord or meet up with some of us in person at various events such as Defcon, SAINTCON, BSides SLC, etc.

## How do I get started?

Perhaps the best place to begin is to head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/uthomelabs/guides/wiki) and read through the options we have there. Some of the code examples will be available either right here in this repository or linked to in the wiki.
